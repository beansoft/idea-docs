### Checking Out Site Repository

To check out the source code run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-sdk-docs.git
```
   
### Initializing Submodules

The site uses JetBrains custom web templates.
To enable custom templates locally, you need to initialize repository submodules.
Run the following command in the checkout directory to do so.
 
```bash
git submodule update --init --remote
```

### Installing Gems

After you performed the initial checkout for the main repository and the submodule, run `bundle install` to install additionally required gems.

### Building and Previewing 
A set of Rake tasks, a Make-like program implemented in Ruby, provides short commands to build and run the site locally.

#### Building Site from Sources
 
*  Make sure you are in a project root directory
*  To build static site content run
   ```
   rake build
   ```
   
#### Previewing

*  To start the web-server run
    ```
    rake preview
    ```
*  Open the address
   [http://localhost:4000/intellij/sdk/docs/](http://localhost:4000/intellij/sdk/docs/)
   in your browser.
   **Note:** Make sure you haven't changed default Jekyll port during installation.
